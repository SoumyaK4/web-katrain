# web-katrain

Browser-based KaTrain-style UI with in-browser KataGo analysis using TensorFlow.js (WebGPU by default, with WASM/CPU fallback and selectable in settings).

## How it works

- React + Zustand manage game state, settings, and the move tree.
- A Web Worker runs KataGo-style evaluation/search on the current position.
- Weights load from `public/models/` or a URL/upload set in Settings.
- Analysis results feed the UI (policy, ownership, winrate/score graphs).

For detailed architecture diagrams and flow explanations, see [docs/diagram.md](docs/diagram.md).

## Development

- Install: `npm install`
- Run: `npm run dev`
- Test: `npm test`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Build: `npm run build` then `npm run preview`

## Models

The default model is the bundled tiny test model (`public/models/katago-small.bin.gz`) so the app starts quickly on
mobile and laptops. Stronger weights, including the practical b18 browser option
`kata1-b18c384nbt-s9996604416-d4316597426.bin.gz` (about 96 MB), are explicit selections in Settings.

Models can also live in `public/models/`. Settings lets you swap URLs or upload weights for the session.
Optional parity assets can be pulled from sibling checkouts:

- `../katrain-ref/` – KaTrain reference (Python/Kivy)
- `../KataGo/` – KataGo reference (C++)

`scripts/fetch-katago-small-model.mjs` keeps the small test model available for local builds.
Set `FETCH_KATRAIN_MODEL=1` if you also want to copy/download KaTrain’s heavier default model into `public/models/` for local testing.

## Performance

WebGPU is the preferred analysis backend. When WebGPU is active with random symmetry enabled, root analysis samples all 8 neural symmetries for a stronger, steadier root policy; WASM and CPU remain fallbacks.

For threaded WASM (XNNPACK), serve with COOP/COEP headers to enable `SharedArrayBuffer`:
`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`.
Vite dev/preview already sends these headers.
The production build includes a `public/_headers` file for static hosts that honor it (Netlify/Cloudflare Pages); other hosts should set equivalent headers.
